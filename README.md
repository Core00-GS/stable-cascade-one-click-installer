### Requirements

- This script requires Python to be installed on your system. Python is **not** included in the one-click installer. If you do not have Python installed, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) before running the installer. I'm using 'Python 3.10.9'.
- Hardware (only tested with 4060 Ti 16 GB VRAM): ![Screenshot of task manager during inference](https://github.com/EtienneDosSantos/stable-cascade-one-click-installer/blob/main/assets/hardware_requirements.jpg)
